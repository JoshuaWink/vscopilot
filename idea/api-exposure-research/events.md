# Chat Events API Exposure

## What is it?
Events related to chat activity: message sent, received, error, session start/end, etc.

## Why expose it?
- Enables real-time integrations (logging, analytics, UI updates).
- Allows extensions to react to chat lifecycle and automate workflows.

## Example use cases
- Log all chat activity for compliance.
- Trigger custom actions on message or error.
- Visualize chat flow in real time.

## Risks/considerations
- Event spam if not filtered or throttled.
- Privacy: events may contain sensitive data.

## Proposed exposure mechanism
- Event emitter for all major chat events.
- VS Code commands for event subscription.
- API export for event listeners.
