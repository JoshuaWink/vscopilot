# Message Objects API Exposure

## What is it?
Access to raw and processed chat message objects, including metadata, roles, timestamps, and content.

## Why expose it?
- Enables advanced UI, analytics, and debugging extensions.
- Allows for custom message processing, filtering, and visualization.

## Example use cases
- Custom chat history viewers.
- Message transformation or enrichment plugins.
- Debugging tools for prompt engineering.

## Risks/considerations
- Privacy: messages may contain sensitive user data.
- Mutability: should be read-only or carefully controlled.

## Proposed exposure mechanism
- API export for message history and live updates.
- VS Code command to fetch messages.
- Event emitter for new/updated messages.
