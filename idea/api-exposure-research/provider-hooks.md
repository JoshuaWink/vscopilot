# Provider Registration & Lifecycle Hooks API Exposure

## What is it?
APIs for registering, updating, or removing chat providers and listening to their lifecycle events.

## Why expose it?
- Enables dynamic provider management and orchestration.
- Supports plugin ecosystems and advanced agent chaining.

## Example use cases
- Extensions that add or swap chat providers at runtime.
- Analytics on provider usage and performance.
- Custom provider lifecycle management tools.

## Risks/considerations
- Security: dynamic registration could be abused.
- Stability: must handle provider errors gracefully.

## Proposed exposure mechanism
- VS Code commands for provider registration/removal.
- Event emitter for provider lifecycle events.
- API export for provider management.
