# Session State API Exposure

## What is it?
Represents the current state of a chat session, including participants, history, and metadata.

## Why expose it?
- Enables extensions to track, resume, or analyze sessions.
- Supports advanced workflows like session bookmarking or transfer.

## Example use cases
- Save/restore chat sessions across VS Code restarts.
- Analytics on session duration, participants, or outcomes.
- Extensions that manage multi-session workflows.

## Risks/considerations
- Privacy: session data may be sensitive.
- Complexity: session state can be large or nested.

## Proposed exposure mechanism
- API export for current and past session state.
- VS Code command to query or save session.
- Event emitter for session lifecycle events.
