# Context Pipeline API Exposure

## What is it?
An API that exposes the full pipeline of context elements (files, selections, system messages, metadata, etc.) before they are sent to the LLM, allowing extensions to inspect, modify, reorder, inject, or remove elements.

## Why expose it?
- Empowers power users and extensions to engineer prompts with surgical precision.
- Enables automation, experimentation, and optimization of context assembly.
- Supports advanced workflows (e.g., context stacking, dynamic ordering, conditional injection).

## Example use cases
- Extensions that reorder context for optimal LLM performance.
- Plugins that inject or redact context based on user or project state.
- UI for visualizing and tweaking the context pipeline before each request.
- Automated prompt engineering tools that experiment with context order and composition.

## Risks/considerations
- Security: extensions could leak or manipulate sensitive context.
- Complexity: pipeline control may be difficult for non-experts.
- Performance: real-time modification must not slow down chat.

## Proposed exposure mechanism
- API export for context pipeline hooks (pre/post assembly).
- Event emitter for context pipeline changes.
- VS Code command to inspect or modify the pipeline.
- Optional: UI for live context pipeline visualization and control.
