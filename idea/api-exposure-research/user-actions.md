# User Action Logs API Exposure

## What is it?
Log of user actions (e.g., button clicks, command invocations) in chat context.

## Why expose it?
- Supports analytics, automation, and compliance.
- Enables workflow automation and audit trails.

## Example use cases
- Usage heatmaps for chat features.
- Trigger automation on specific user actions.
- Audit trails for compliance or debugging.

## Risks/considerations
- Privacy: logs may contain sensitive or identifiable data.
- Volume: high-frequency actions could create large logs.

## Proposed exposure mechanism
- Event emitter for user action events.
- API export for action logs.
- VS Code command to query or filter actions.
