# Execution Hooks API Exposure

## What is it?
APIs for running extension code before or after a chat message is processed.

## Why expose it?
- Enables automation, validation, and augmentation of chat flows.
- Supports chaining, logging, and custom workflows.

## Example use cases
- Pre-processing or validation of user input.
- Post-processing or enrichment of responses.
- Logging or analytics hooks for every message.

## Risks/considerations
- Stability: hooks must not block or break chat flow.
- Security: hooks could be abused if not sandboxed.

## Proposed exposure mechanism
- API export for registering pre/post hooks.
- Event emitter for hook execution.
- VS Code command to manage hooks.
