# No-Op MCP Tool for Loop Extension

**Concept:**
Implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool that performs no real action (a "no-op"), but is exposed to the LLM as a callable tool. The purpose is to allow the agent to call this tool when it needs to continue the tool calling loop, effectively buying more time to iterate and maintain inference state.

**Motivation:**
- Enables the LLM to keep the agentic loop alive even when no meaningful tool action is required.
- Useful for scenarios where the agent needs to "think" or wait for more context, or when it wants to maintain conversational or inference continuity.
- Can be used for debugging, prompt engineering, or as a fallback to avoid premature loop termination.

**How it works:**
- Register a no-op MCP tool (e.g., `noop_mcp`) in the available tools list.
- The LLM can call this tool as a placeholder action.
- The system recognizes the call, performs no operation, and returns a trivial result (e.g., `{ "status": "noop" }`).
- The loop continues, preserving agent state and allowing further tool calls or reasoning steps.

**Potential Use Cases:**
- Agentic workflows that require more than the default number of tool call rounds.
- Maintaining inference state across long-running or multi-step tasks.
- Giving the LLM a way to "pause" or defer action without breaking the loop.
